# Cat vs Dog Image Classification using SVM

This project implements a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** model to classify images of cats and dogs.  
It uses basic image preprocessing and feature extraction, followed by SVM classification.

The project is intended for **learning machine learning concepts**, especially:
- Image preprocessing
- Feature extraction
- SVM classification
- Model evaluation


##  Project Overview

- Dataset: Cats and Dogs images (e.g., Kaggle dataset)
- Algorithm: Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Language: Python
- Environment: Jupyter Notebook


## Workflow

1. Load image dataset
2. Resize and preprocess images
3. Convert images to feature vectors
4. Split data into training and testing sets
5. Train SVM classifier
6. Evaluate model performance



## Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report



##  Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook



##  How to Run

1. Install required libraries using `requirements.txt`
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook
3. Run all cells step by step



## Future Improvements

- Use CNN for better accuracy
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Data augmentation
- Use validation dataset
